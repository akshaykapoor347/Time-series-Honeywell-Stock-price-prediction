# Time-series-Honeywell-Stock-price-prediction
We make use of time series to predict the future values of the Honeywell stock. We perform exponential smoothing forecast on Honeywell stock prices with varying value of parameters to find the best fit. To find the best fit we make use of SSE and MSE and compare all the values. We also perform the prediction using linear regression analysis and compare the results with exponential smoothing forecast. We find the coefficient of correlation and determination. We learn more about the residuals and their shapes when used in scatterplots. We also find the actual Honeywell stock price and compare it with all our forecasts.  More information updated in the word/pdf file.
